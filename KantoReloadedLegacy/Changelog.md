# Kanto Reloaded Legacy Changelog

## Kanto Reloaded Legacy Update #8 - KIF Support

v1.6.0

Release Date: October 23, 2026

### SUMMARY
Kanto Reloaded is now Kanto Reloaded Legacy and runs on KIF 1.0.7 or newer. It's the original Kanto Reloaded, kept working while the new Kanto Reloaded is built. The two can't run together: with both on, KIF loads Kanto Reloaded and blocks Legacy. Every setting now lives in KIF Settings, and features that didn't carry over to KIF were removed.

### CHANGES
- Renamed to Kanto Reloaded Legacy (mod folder `Mods/KantoReloadedLegacy`). Saves keep all their Kanto Reloaded data
- All settings moved into KIF Settings, in the KR Legacy section, with one heading per feature
  - Settings that only matter while a feature is on are listed under it and hide while it's off
  - Changed settings show KIF's changed dot, and Z resets a setting to its default
  - Your settings carry over: the ones kept per save come with your save, and on first start Legacy copies the rest from your old Kuray's Infinite Fusion save folder (the old file isn't changed)
- Move Effectiveness is now called Effectiveness Borders, so it isn't confused with KIF's Move Effectiveness
- The Reloaded PC supports Hoenn's Transfer Box, the way the game's own PC does
  - Rental and duplicate Pokémon are refused before they leave their box, so nothing is lost
  - Items, nicknames, fusing, renaming, wallpapers, sorting and locks aren't available in the Transfer Box
- The Reloaded PC's Buy Box, sort and export locks, Export and Import run KIF's own box tools
- The Reloaded PC's Focus button is now Y (S on the keyboard): on KIF, X is the speed-up key
- With the Overworld Menu on, R on the map only opens the menu and no longer resets KIF's speed-up to 1x
- Double Abilities stands down for KIF: Elite Redux: with it on, Elite Redux picks a fusion's abilities, handles Ability Capsules and shows them on the Summary
- The RLD Shop sells everything KIF's Kuray Shop sells, plus the Rocket Ball and the K-Eggs
- Bulk Purchase Rewards also gives KIF's own bonus items for every 10 bought (DNA Reverser for Super Splicers, DNA Splicers for DNA Reversers)
- TM Vault's Egg Moves in Relearn follow KIF's own Egg Moves option. Tutor moves stay free
- Super Candy follows KIF's level cap
- Double Abilities: KIF's Battle Info lists both abilities. A foe's second ability shows as ??? until it activates
- Weather: Fog now covers the map with a fog layer
- PokeVial works on every map in Hoenn
- The Overworld Menu doesn't open while you're moving furniture
- The save backup made before a Legacy update shows in the game's Load Backup menu as "Before KR Legacy Update"
- A fresh install keeps the game's own font and window frames

### REMOVED
- The Kanto Reloaded Options screen (replaced by the KR Legacy section in KIF Settings)
- Mart Events, and the Economy System switch that turned all Mart features on or off (each Mart feature keeps its own switch)
- Quick Throw, the Randomizer, the Battle Menu, the Save Manager and the Timing Profiler
- File a Bug Report and the About rows
- Wild Link's Gather Map Data
- Reloaded PC Speed and Animations (the PC always animates in full and no longer changes the game speed)
- Gym Leader Full Party
- TM Vault Egg Moves (KIF's own Egg Moves option decides)
- Option Color, Category Color, Global Small Text, Menu Frame and Speech Follows Menu (Cursor Color stays)
- Mod Settings support for other mods, and support for Kuray's settings presets
- The follower picture packs (KIF has the same pictures)

### BUG FIXES
- Fixed fusing and unfusing in the Reloaded PC
- Fixed box wallpapers not showing in the Reloaded PC
- Fixed the TM Vault not opening from the pause menu
- Fixed Regular Marts skipping the shopkeeper's goodbye and "anything else?" lines
- Fixed buying 10 or more DNA Splicers giving two DNA Reversers
- Fixed the RLD Shop's stock pointing at the wrong items
- Fixed the save backup clean-up deleting older backups that weren't Kanto Reloaded's
- Fixed the Summary replaying the Pokémon's cry when switching between its two abilities
- Fixed a second ability's pop-up marking the first ability as revealed in Battle Info and Move Effectiveness
- Fixed Double Abilities' battle checks running while Double Abilities was off
- Fixed "Could not load global settings" being logged at every start on a fresh install
- Fixed the Reloaded PC's L button cycling focus instead of going to the previous box
- Fixed Neutral Border (also the Reloaded EBDX Cursor's color) being hidden while Effectiveness Borders is off
- Fixed settings showing under the wrong feature in KIF Settings before a save is loaded
- Fixed items added to the RLD Shop (like HM01) failing to buy
- Fixed a crash when choosing a battle command right after closing Battle Info with EBDX
- Fixed RLD Shop edits for TMs and HMs you own being thrown away, so adding one you had never stuck
- Owned TMs and HMs stay in the RLD Shop, marked OWNED, instead of disappearing
- Fixed the Nature Selector failing when you back out of the nature list
- Fixed settings and shop files being read by running them as code (KIF's JSON reader); Legacy now reads and writes them itself, and its version shows correctly in the log

### TECHNICAL
- Every hook whose game method is missing is now logged once as "Hook skipped" instead of failing silently
- The log's start line names KIF and its version

## Kanto Reloaded Update #7 - Hotfixes

### BUG FIXES
- Fixed ordinary randomized wild encounters being processed again as static encounters

- Fixed Team Expansion's Add Count and Target Team Size values not being directly editable in Trainer Control

### TECHNICAL
- Hardened Double Abilities reconciliation across native, EBDX, item, trade, reversal, and direct species-change paths

## Kanto Reloaded Update #5 - Mart Dynamics

v1.5.0

Release Date: August 13, 2026

### SUMMARY
This update brings changing sales and shortages to regular Marts, adds optional Reloaded Mart interfaces, expands money settings, and adds paid Reloaded PC services. It also fixes issues across Trainer Control, Double Abilities, Weather, Healing Overworld Moves, and the Overworld Menu.

### FEATURES

  - Mart Events can affect selected items, an item category, or the entire shop
- Added Mart Events as an optional Overworld Menu command for checking, filtering, and tracking active events
- Added Starting Money and Battle Money settings
- Added paid Reset EVs and Friendship Boost actions to the Reloaded PC Menu
  - Service prices can be customized, and Friendship Boost previews the result

- Fixed Healing Overworld Moves closing the Party Menu after using a healing move

- Added number pickers for Starting Money and Reloaded PC service prices

### TECHNICAL
- Added guarded native payout and new-game hooks with persistent location-based shop identities

### DEVELOPER
- Added a stable Economy System API and Reloaded PC action-registry integrations

## Kanto Reloaded Update #4 - Shifting Skies

v1.4.2

Release Date: August 3, 2026

### SUMMARY
This update introduces persistent regional weather and forecasting with battle integration, custom ambience, and multiplayer safeguards while improving Wild Link previews and Overworld Menu responsiveness.

### FEATURES
- Added a regional Weather System with persistent climate-based or fully random weather cells, weather forecasts, Overworld Menu forecast views, and battle-weather integration
- Added a global Wild Link Sprites option for switching detail previews between Pokémon icons and full battle sprites

### IMPROVEMENTS
- Improved the Overworld Menu so map graphics and world-time updates continue while the overlay and its popups are open
- Improved Wild Link opening so the initially selected row's Pokémon preview is loaded before the completed scene becomes visible

### BUG FIXES
- Fixed authored Wild Link Rare Signals being remapped by encounter and Static Encounter randomization instead of matching the live Poké Radar-exclusive species
- Fixed Wild Link invoking KIF's popup-producing battle randomizer while building roster rows; static encounter results are now resolved directly without repeated error prompts
- Fixed Wild Link repeatedly presenting stale loading frames and requiring additional button presses before the completed scene appeared
- Fixed Wild Link fusion previews collapsing to the shared icon 000 placeholder and Seen species remaining black silhouettes
- Fixed Wild Link detail previews inheriting Big Icons, miscomposing valid species with fallback fusion components, shrinking unintended full battle sprites into icon-sized space, failing to resolve exact fusion icons, and allowing invalid species to display KIF's Pikachu fallback; previews now use Pokémon icon assets by default

### VISUALS & UI
- Added non-pausing upper-left alerts for local Weather System changes

### AUDIO
- Added optional continuous rain, storm, and heavy-rain ambience to the Weather System with randomized thunder timing and independent rain and thunder audio toggles

### PERFORMANCE
- Removed first-open Wild Link stalls caused by constructing complete fusion battle data for roster rows; fusion names, Pokédex keys, and icon paths now use lightweight references, previews load only after active row focus, and completed scenes are presented immediately
- Packed 2,302 Wild Link fusion follower graphics into two lazily opened ZIP-compatible `.pak` archives, reducing update file count while preserving on-demand normal and shiny silhouettes

### TECHNICAL
- Added guarded PvP weather negotiation that synchronizes initiator battle weather only when both clients confirm Kanto Reloaded support and suppresses unsynchronized local weather in co-op

### DEVELOPER
- Added a data-only Weather System map override registry for eligibility, cell grouping, climate, and forecast-label exceptions

## Kanto Reloaded Update #3 - Signals & Supplies

v1.3.2

Release Date: July 27, 2026

### SUMMARY
This update strengthens Wild Link with more accurate randomized rosters, safer field targets, clearer progression details, and faster previews while expanding Mart bulk-purchase rewards and reducing Double Abilities battle overhead.

### FEATURES
- Added deterministic Rare Signal species targeting roughly 50 BST above the route average on maps without authored Poké Radar encounters

### IMPROVEMENTS
- File A Bug Report now uploads and copies separate links for both the sanitized bug report and full current log

### BALANCE
- Added one Potion per 10 Super Potions, Hyper Potions, or Max Potions purchased in a single transaction

### BUG FIXES
- Fixed chance-based and forced wild fusions being persisted in Wild Link rosters instead of showing only fusions supplied by randomized encounter tables
- Fixed Wild Link Surf searches selecting bridge tiles, placing overworld Pokemon on land, and launching battles from map updates in a way that could cause white-screen crashes
- Fixed Dynamic Pokemon encounters expanding Wild Link's persistent searchable roster
- Fixed Wild Link omitting KIF's final Static Encounter mapping from randomized table, Rare Signal, and generic Rock Smash fallback species
- Fixed Wild Link showing authored encounter species instead of KIF's effective Global or Area randomized encounter roster
- Expanded per-10 Premier Ball and DNA Reverser purchase rewards to regular marts
- Fixed bug reports omitting errors that had fallen outside the newest 300 log lines
- Fixed Wild Link hiding valid Surf encounter tables until the player was already surfing

- Fixed Wild Link placement failures being hidden when Messages was Off
- Fixed fusion component evolution replacing still-legal Double Abilities with KIF's post-evolution ability-index result
- Fixed active Wild Link Rock Smash indicators remaining owned by the previous map spriteset and crashing during map transfers
- Fixed Wild Link combining Morning, Day, and Night species instead of showing KIF's currently active time-based encounter table

### VISUALS & UI
- Added live bulk-purchase reward previews to Reloaded Shop and standard Mart purchase confirmations
- Added per-method Seen and Caught completion counters to the Wild Link header
- Added KR purchase-reward prompts showing how many bonus items were added in Reloaded Shop and regular marts
- Added Input Z switching between Wild Link Search Level information and Current Bonuses for inactive links and active targets
- Replaced Wild Link's ambiguous Potential label with the generated target's exact perfect-IV count
- Highlighted unresolved Wild Link Rare Signals and revealed rare-species roster rows in gold
- Replaced missing Wild Link overworld graphics with Pikachu while preserving fully black silhouettes for unknown targets

### PERFORMANCE
- Reduced Wild Link roster redraw work by caching row display data and moving cursor pulsing onto a dedicated sprite layer
- Cached stable Double Abilities battler eligibility, secondary ability resolution, and legal-pair validation instead of repeating species-data work across battle handlers

### TECHNICAL
- Added scoped Dynamic Pokemon suppression so Wild Link can resolve stable native randomizer mappings without consuming a Dynamic encounter roll

### DEVELOPER
- Added a Wild Link Gather Map Data diagnostic exporter for current-map metadata, terrain, field events, eligibility, and encounter tables
